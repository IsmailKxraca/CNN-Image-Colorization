# CNN-Image-Colorization

This project aims to develop an AI for image colorization using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is based on the method from the paper [„Colorful Image Colorization“](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) by Richard Zhang and uses publicly available datasets for training.
