# CNN-Image-Colorization

## Overview  
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic image colorization based on the method proposed by Richard Zhang et al. 
The model takes grayscale images as input and predicts their corresponding colorized versions.

## Installation  
To set up the project, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsmailKxraca/CNN-Image-Colorization.git
   cd CNN-Image-Colorization

2. Install dependencies
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Try my model
I implemnted a Streamlit-Website for UI. You can start it with:
```
python -m streamlit run [path to CNN-Image-Colorization\scripts\website.py]
```
