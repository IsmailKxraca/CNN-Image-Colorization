# CNN-Image-Colorization

This project aims to develop an AI for image colorization using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is based on the method from the paper [„Colorful Image Colorization“](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) by Richard Zhang and uses publicly available datasets for training.

For the prototype version im using a part of the dataset:
Linjie Yang, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, Xiaoou Tang. A Large-Scale Car Dataset for Fine-Grained Categorization and Verification, In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.
